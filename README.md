Hello, and welcome! I'm Rachit Patel.
Thank you for visiting my portfolio website.

I'm a technology enthusiast with a strong foundation in Computer Science, currently working as an Assistant Professor in CSE (AI & ML), and actively exploring opportunities to bridge the gap between education, innovation, and industry leadership. This website is a curated space where I share my academic achievements, technical projects, and professional experiences.

Whether it's building efficient algorithms, analyzing real-world data, or managing academic and operational systems, I’m driven by curiosity and a commitment to continuous improvement. My goal is to create impact—through code, through teaching, and through collaboration.

This site is a work in progress and will be updated regularly with new content including technical blogs, project showcases, and useful resources. Feel free to explore, connect, or reach out if you'd like to collaborate or discuss ideas.

Let’s grow together in the journey of tech and innovation.
